Developed for Ergofox GmbH, these games use motion tracking to turn therapeutic exercises into gameplay mechanics.\n\nThe suite includes several themed runners, each targeting different muscle groups and movement patterns. As players perform their prescribed exercises, their movements control the game character, making therapy sessions more enjoyable and increasing adherence to treatment plans.",

I also gained valuable insights into developing games for healthcare applications, including accessibility considerations and clinical efficacy requirements.",
